Somewhere along the way (A song we like)
I got caught up in the race  
I kept spinning and turning  
Lost myself, my hope, my faith  

We're always wanting more than what we have  
And what I've learned is all I really need are  

The simple things that come without a price  
The simple things like happiness, joy and love in my life  
I've seen it all from so many sides and I hope you would agree  
The best things in life are the simple things  

Say everybody don't get me wrong  
You got to understand  
Ambition and knowledge  
Are the seeds of every woman and man  

It's good to work, work hard and prosper  
As long as you take time to find  

The simple things that come without a price  
The simple things like happiness, joy and love in my life  
I've seen it all from so many sides and I hope you would agree  
That the best things in life are the simple things  

All the simple things  
They're the simple things  
Just the simple things  
They are the simple things  

All the simple things  
This world moves so fast  
They're the simple things  
Sometimes you got to slow down, down, down  
To find out what it's all about  

We're always wanting more than what we have  
What I've learned, is all I really need are  

The simple things that come without a price  
The simple things like happiness, joy and love in my life  
I've seen it all from so many sides and I hope you would agree  
That the best things in life are the simple things  

Girl you know it now, the simple things in life  
That's when everything's  
Love and happiness with joy sometimes  
These are the simple things that I need, oh  
The simple things in life  
Girl you know it now, the simple things in life
